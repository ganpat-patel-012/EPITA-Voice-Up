# EPITA - Voice Up  
> **A Community-Driven Issue Reporting Platform**  

## 🚀 Introduction  
**Voice Up** is a **public issue reporting platform** designed to bridge the gap between citizens and public departments.  
It allows users to:  
✔ **Report issues** in their locality with images, descriptions, and location data.  
✔ **Vote on issues** (Upvote if legit, Downvote if fake).  
✔ **Track issue status** as departments take action.  
✔ **Improve accountability** of public services through data-driven insights.  

### 🌍 Why This Matters?  
Every day, we encounter **potholes, water leaks, streetlight failures, and sanitation issues**. Many go unnoticed due to a lack of direct reporting to authorities.  
**Voice Up** ensures these issues are prioritized based on community validation.
